# Instructions

Inside the src directory, you will find the files of the project.

It's a simple HTML page, there is no need to run it with any web server, simply double click on the HTML page and open it with any web browser.

## Exercise 1

Modify the code so that when a user hovers on the Slide out button, the button slides out of the page with an animation.
Try to use just Javascript (not CSS) for the animation.

## Exercise 2

Style the button with CSS so that it looks like below

## Exercise 3

Modify the code so that when a user clicks on the button, it creates 10 clones of the button and appends them to the HTML page.
Each clone must have its index displayed as the button text (see image below). 
On second click, the opposite needs to happen. All buttons should be removed except for the first.

If possible, use vanilla Javascript (no JQuery or other libraries).
