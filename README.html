  >1. Modify the code so that when a user hovers on the Slide out button, the
  button slides out of the page with an animation. Try to use just Javascript (not CSS) for the animation.
</p>

<p>2. Style the button with CSS so that it looks like below</p>
<img width="300px" src="step-2.png" />


<p>3. Modify the code so that when a user clicks on the button, it creates 10 clones of the button and appends them to the HTML page. Each clone must have its index displayed as the button text (see image below).</p>
